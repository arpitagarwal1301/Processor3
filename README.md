# Processor3
Project for parsing strings.xml and creating data class with default values

Notes : 
1. Modify the code as per the requirements
2. Handle string-array, plurals separately
3. IMPORTANT : Don't forget to close the processing manually otherwise for some cases it might continue and fill up your disk space.
